          <h3>Serious Weather Events</h3>
          <p>Climate change increases the frequency and severity of storms and other major weather events.
          For Boston, this means more extreme snow storms and sub zero cold snaps as a result of arctic oscillation which
        allows arctic air to flow into lower latitudes. These extreme weather events impact our infrastructure and transit, especially the old and neglected MBTA.
           Chronically underfunded, the MBTA has years of delayed maintenance that's vulnerable to extreme weather events. Climate change will put increasing pressure
          on the MBTA, which over a million commuters rely on daily. Delays and service
          interruptions will become more and more frequent, disrupting commuters' lives, especially lower income commuters who are more vulnerable to service disruptions.
          Commuters don't have alternate transportation, rely on hourly wages, may live farther from their jobs and have less flexibility to work remotely are especially impacted by
          service disruptions. Image Source: LolMBTA</p>

          <h3>Transit delays on a (very) cold day</h3>
          <p>Storms are an obvious cause of transit delays and damage to key transit infrastructure, but other types of
            extreme weather can cause problems too.
            On December 28, 2017 the MBTA trains and buses were slowed by mechanical malfunctions on a bitterly cold day,
            temps were in the single digits and it caused major problems along multiple routes. Both weather and commuter
            volume impacts transit, so the worst delays cluster around peak commuting hours. This streamgraph shows travel time
            throughout the day, as measured by actual travel time as a percentage of benchmark travel time. The benchmark travel time is an average travel time for that particular time period- so it already accounts for the usual delays.
            Travel time above the benchmark (in this visualization, over 100%) is an extreme delay.

          <h3>Train delays on December 28</h3>
          <p>This map of the MBTA shows where the worst delays happened between 8:30am and 8:45am on December 28, 2017.
            The effect of these delays is cumulative- commuters coming from the final stops experience delays
            along the entire route. As in the streamgraph, delays are measured by calculating the actual time as a percentage of the benchmark travel time.
            Pulling performance data from the MBTA is difficult and imperfect, some of the connections are missing data and symbolized in grey.
             These gaps are both an issue with the API itself and probably a little bit of user error too.

          <h3>Transit Delays and Vulnerability</h3>
          <p>The relationship between the impact of climate change induced transit delays and a neighborhood's
            vulnerability isn't as clear cut as we had expected: the red line is an older system and it had pretty major delays on December 28th
            and it's a relatively wealthy corridor. However, transit delays still hurt low income commuters the most. People who are paid hourly
            may lose income or valuable time with their family when the MBTA gets delayed. Salaried workers and people who can work from home don't face the same
            risk. Follow the link to see income v. transit delays to the central business district for the train lines in Boston.

          <h3>Midterm Goals</h3>
          <p>Our original goal was to map how storms impact transit time, using
            isochrones on a map of Boston. We hoped to visualize both transit delays and vulnerability by showing
            how travel isochrones change during a storm alongside income or poverty information for the
            neighborhoods. Though our visualizations don't match the proposal, we were able to achieve some of our goals: querying MBTA data and visualizing
             how transit time changes during an extreme weather event. Next steps for this analysis would include visualizing how these delays impact
             specific neighborhoods and vulnerable populations, comparing Dec. 28th to a normal day and looking at other storm events.
