<p> <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">Five Thirty Eight</a> has a ton of cool data
	visualizations but their Atlas of Redistricting is particularly inspiring. The project
	allows users to explore different districting scenarios either at a national or state
	scale. The project highlights the challenges of districting, specifically, that while
	condemning gerrymandering is easy developing a new districting scheme is difficult.</p>
